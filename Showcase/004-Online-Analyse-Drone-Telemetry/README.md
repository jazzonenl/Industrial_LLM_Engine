# AI-Enhanced Drone Anti-Jamming System

This simulator showcases an AI-powered solution designed to protect drones from jamming attacks. Using a custom flight emulator driven by real-world telemetry, our system continuously monitors flight data to detect early signs of signal disruption and alert the operator with actionable insights.

## üéØ Key Objectives

- **Prevent Flight Disruptions:** Detect early jamming events to avoid loss of control.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously analyze drone telemetry data to identify abnormal trends.
- **Clear Communication:** Deliver intuitive, plain-language alerts to guide operator actions.
- **Robust Testing:** Validate the system using a simplified flight emulator built from real DJI Air 2S flight logs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

Our AI module is integrated within a drone flight emulator that replicates essential flight dynamics using actual flight log data. Key aspects include:

- **Drone Emulator with Basic Physics:** Simulates virtual flight using parameters such as altitude, vertical speed, engine RPM, battery status, flight time, and total distance.
- **Telemetry Integration:** Incorporates real-world metrics like GPS signal quality, gyroscope, and accelerometer readings to mimic actual drone performance.
- **Continuous Data Analysis:** The AI module monitors the drone‚Äôs ‚Äúpulse‚Äù ‚Äî detecting erratic changes in critical parameters (e.g., fluctuating GPS signals or sudden vertical speed spikes) that may indicate jamming.
- **Operator Alerts:** Instead of cryptic error codes, the system issues clear messages (e.g., ‚ÄúStrong radio interference detected. Recommend returning to base or altering the route.‚Äù).

## ‚úÖ Key Results

- **Early Jamming Detection:** The system identifies potential jamming conditions before complete signal loss, enabling timely corrective actions.
- **Intuitive Dashboard:** An interactive control panel displays real-time graphs and key metrics, offering a cockpit-like view of the drone‚Äôs status.
- **Enhanced Safety:** By providing early warnings and clear directives, the solution significantly improves operational safety in challenging environments.
