# Predictive Maintenance & Root Cause Analysis for EUV Equipment

This simulator demonstrates how predictive analytics, synthetic telemetry generation, and a custom-built LLM analysis engine can be used to enable advanced predictive maintenance and root cause analysis for complex industrial systems ‚Äî with a focus on EUV lithography equipment.

## üéØ Key Objectives

- Develop a high-load telemetry simulation to test signal processing and anomaly detection algorithms.
- Validate root cause analysis methods using realistic failure scenarios and complex sensor behavior.
- Design a system for air-gapped environments with zero reliance on external services.
- Enable real-time log analysis and digital signal interpretation using custom LLMs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

To test the core algorithms of the **Industrial LLM Engine**, we created a high-frequency simulation of EUV machine behavior, generating structured and unstructured log data under various degradation and failure scenarios.

### Key Components:

- **EUV Log Emulator**: Simulates 10,000+ sensors at up to 100 Hz, producing log-style telemetry in real-time. Designed to mimic realistic degradation, spikes, and rare failure patterns.
- **Parallel Computing Framework**: Implements in-memory multithreaded processing (200+ concurrent processes) to generate up to 60 GB of telemetry data per day.
- **Custom LLM for Log Analysis**: Built from scratch to parse and digitize logs, recognize anomaly patterns, and operate locally without internet access.
- **Advanced Signal Metrics**: Includes 50+ indicators for statistical trends, spectral entropy, oscillation, modulation, and more ‚Äî tailored for industrial diagnostics.

## ‚úÖ Key Results

- Realistic emulation of EUV equipment logs enabled robust stress-testing of anomaly detection algorithms.
- Detected system degradation (e.g., laser power decline) using time-series and spectral trend analysis.
- Digitized telemetry logs using LLM and identified failure patterns as structured time functions.
- Built a foundation for anomaly fingerprinting and root cause classification using pure signal data.
- Confirmed that real-time analysis of massive telemetry streams is feasible on mid-scale hardware.
