# EUV Machine Log Emulator

This project emulates the generation of logs for an EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) machine as part of the [Industrial LLM Engine project](https://github.com/jazzonenl/Industrial_LLM_Engine). The emulator simulates various subsystems of the machine, creates synthetic parameters, applies degradation events, and generates corresponding log entries.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jazzonenl/Industrial_LLM_Engine.git
cd Industrial_LLM_Engine



### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Creating a virtual environment helps to manage dependencies without affecting your system-wide packages.

**On Windows:**

python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate

**On macOS/Linux:**
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate


### 3. Install Required Packages
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
The required dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Then, install the dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Run the Script
To run the EUV Machine Log Emulator, simply execute:

python euv_log_emulator.py

### 5. (Optional) Run with a Custom Configuration
If you wish to use a custom configuration file, pass the configuration path using the --config flag:

python euv_log_emulator.py --config path/to/config.json
