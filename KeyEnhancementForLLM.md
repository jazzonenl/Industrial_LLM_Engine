# The Myth of "Semantic Magic" of Large Language Models: Why Linguistic Models Fail in Some Tasks

Today, every technical report features familiar words: **GloVe**, **BERT**, **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, **embeddings**, **LLM**. These models turn text into vectors — supposedly "smart" numerical representations that understand that "automobile" and "machine/car" are similar in meaning. A beautiful concept, especially if you're training a chatbot.

## Strengths of LLMs

LLMs excel in numerous tasks beyond chatbot training. They are highly effective in:

- **Language Translation:** Converting text from one language to another while maintaining context and nuance.
- **Text Summarization:** Condensing long articles or documents into concise summaries without losing key information.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in text to gauge public sentiment.
- **Question Answering:** Providing accurate answers to specific questions by comprehending and retrieving relevant information.
- **Content Generation:** Producing creative text such as articles, stories, and even poetry, which can be valuable in content creation and marketing.
- **Code Generation and Debugging:** Assisting developers by generating code snippets, explaining code functionality, or even identifying bugs.
- **Text Classification:** Sorting text into predefined categories, which is useful for spam detection, topic labeling, and more.

These examples demonstrate the versatility and strength of LLMs in handling tasks centered around language understanding and generation.

## Challenges Beyond Text

But what if you're analyzing:

- Telemetry
- Customer profiles
- Equipment data
- Financial flows
- IoT Sensor Data
- Manufacturing Process Data
- Energy Consumption Logs
- Retail and E-commerce Transactions
- Healthcare Monitoring, etc.

What if you're not working with words, but with numbers, events, and digitized reality? This is where the entire linguistic world of LLMs turns out to be blind and one-sided.

### Where LLMs Don't Work — and Never Will Work Correctly

LLMs see everything as language. To them, `"Temperature = 38.4"` is just another string—they don't inherently grasp that such a temperature could indicate that a person is feeling unwell, whereas the same reading might be perfectly normal for animals.

When faced with numerous sensor readings and parameters, particularly from new or evolving devices not included in its training corpus, the model simply cannot understand these signals. In scenarios where data is dynamic and ever-changing, relying solely on language-based models to interpret numerical or technical parameters is inherently flawed.

All their "smart vectors" are the result of tokenization and probabilistic statistics derived from Wikipedia, Reddit, and books. But no pressure sensor writes on Reddit. No SCADA system transmits data in the form of a novel.

### The Philosophy of Language Models: Beautiful but Dangerously One-Sided

LLMs operate on the postulate: **"Understanding = context in the text."** This works for translation, answering questions, and generating recipes.

But this philosophy shatters like glass when confronted not with language, but with:

- Sensor signals
- A customer profile in CRM
- The structure of bank transactions
- The telemetry flow from machines or drones, etc.

LLMs try to interpret numbers through text, values through words. And therein lies their fundamental flaw.

## What's Needed Is Not "Word Magic" but Common Sense and Geometry

In telemetry analysis tasks, everything is different. Here, what matters is:

- **Structure**
- **The form of data**
- **Deviations from the norm**

What's needed are stable vectors that:

- Do not depend on training
- Do not require gigabytes of corpus
- Do not "guess" meaning but clearly reflect parameters

This is achieved by a different approach: a **mathematical vectorizer**, which takes data—numbers, strings, parameters, profiles, exchange rates—and builds a vector that reflects the structural essence, not the "context of words."

### What's the Real Advantage?

- **Interpretability:** The same profile always yields the same vector.
- **Speed:** No training, tokenization, or model warm-up.
- **Simplicity:** You control the model, not the other way around.
- **Comparability:** Any two objects are geometrically comparable—regardless of language, format, or context.

## Conclusion

Not all tasks require understanding words. Some require understanding data. If your system handles telemetry, calculates parameters, or analyzes behavior—forget about BERT embeddings, OpenAI, and other language models. They don't know what "overheating," "current spike," or "unusual customer profile" mean. In these tasks, it's not linguistics that wins. **Mathematics wins.**

This is exactly the kind of task that an **Industrial LLM engine** solves—a system that does not replace LLMs, but helps them understand the world of numbers, signals, and telemetry.
