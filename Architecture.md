# High-Level Architecture

Industrial LLM-Engine is implemented as a modular, scalable, and easily extendable architecture designed for processing and analyzing telemetry data. The solution is built using modern architectural patterns such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and a microservices approach, ensuring flexibility, fault tolerance, and the ability to rapidly scale horizontally even in high-load environments. All modules are proprietary developments equipped with their own mathematical apparatus optimized for specific data processing tasks.

## Key Components and Patterns

- **API Gateway and Request Processing Module:**  
  Incoming requests are centrally handled via an API Gateway, which routes them to the appropriate services. The request processing module validates incoming data, manages sessions, and interacts with a caching system (Redis) to store request histories and statistical data.

- **Vectorization Module:**  
  This module is responsible for converting heterogeneous data (text, numerical values, mixed formats) into a unified vector space. By applying the Data Transformation pattern, the module aggregates data into tensor structures, which facilitates further analysis in a multi-vector space. This module is developed using its own mathematical apparatus to ensure high accuracy and efficiency in transformation.

- **Interpretation and Diagnostics Module:**  
  Within the framework of an Event-Driven Architecture, this module analyzes the vector space representing the equipment's state to detect deviations, anomalies, and degradation. The interpretation results are then forwarded for further processing by large language models, aiding in prompt managerial decision-making.

- **Interaction Module with Language Models:**  
  This module provides integration with modern large language models (e.g., GPT, BERT, etc.), leveraging their capabilities for deep analysis and interpretation of telemetry processing results. Implemented as a separate service, it is part of the proprietary development and is equipped with a specialized mathematical apparatus for working with contextual information.

- **Connector Module for Industrial Data Buses:**  
  This module enables integration with various industrial data buses such as Modbus, OPC UA, Profibus, Ethernet/IP, and CAN. It facilitates the acquisition of telemetry data from equipment across different industrial networks and transmits it into the system for further processing.

- **Configuration Management Module:**  
  The configuration management module centrally controls the system parameters for various users and devices. Utilizing the Centralized Configuration pattern, it allows dynamic adaptation of processing and monitoring algorithms in response to changing operational conditions.

## Component Interaction

The data processing workflow is organized as a well-defined data pipeline. Telemetry data from industrial sensors and various data buses, obtained via the connector module, are fed through the API Gateway into the request processing module, where initial validation and aggregation occur. Next, the vectorization module converts this data into tensor representations, which are then passed to the interpretation module for pattern and anomaly detection. The interaction module with language models leverages the processing results for further interpretation and the generation of management recommendations. In parallel, the configuration management module ensures the continuous updating of processing parameters, enabling the system to quickly adapt to changes in the external environment.

This high-level architectural approach guarantees a reliable, scalable, and adaptive solution for analyzing industrial telemetry, thereby promoting effective problem detection and equipment optimization.
